<h1> Azimuth</h1>

<p>
Azimuth (ˈæzɪməθ ) is a mathematical concept defined as the angle, usually measured in degrees (°), between a reference plane and a point. This concept is used in many practical applications including navigation, astronomy, mapping, mining and artillery. The word azimuth is derived from the Arabic السمت ('as-sumūt') which means the ways, referring to the ways or directions a person faces. (Wikipedia)

<h2> <%= link_to "Signup/Login", :controller => :session, :action => :new %></h2>

<p>
Anyone can signup to the app. We happily provide an openID option as well.

<h2> <%= link_to "Start a Hunt", :controller => :pirate, :action => :index %></h2>

<p>
Users can create a treasure hunt where they have teams compete to find all the clues. The user will have to create treasures and associate with them clues and locations. The locations will be specified using latitude and longitude coordinates. The user can also specify how close the competing teams need to be to the treasure in order for them to be able to unlock it. The hunt owner (a.k.a "Pirate") sets up an ordered list of treasures that the teams have to complete but can customize the starting point for each team.

<h2><%= link_to "Compete in a hunt", :controller => :hunters, :action => :index %></h2>

<p>
Users may choose to compete in a hunt set up by someone else. They can participate in teams of at least one person (d'oh). Each team will follow clues sent to them by the "Pirate" which will lead them to the location of the treasure. Once there they can send their location coordinates to verify that they have successfully solved the current clue. Which will allow them to receive the next clue in the hunt. The goal is to finish the hunt with the most points.

<h2> Mobile Users</h2>

<p>
Each user that signs in will provide their mobile number which will be used to send clues about treasures in hunts and to send back answers once the clue is solved. We use a third party service to perform these actions and we do not save the user's phone number. Instead we automatically create an account for the user with that third party company and use that username for all mobile purposes. 
</p>

<h3>iPhone Users</h3>
<p>
A mobile interface exists for iPhone users. The home page of the application will automatically detect if the user is connected through an iPhone and will prompt him to enter a key to access the hunt he is participating in. The key will be provided in the web page of the hunt when the user joins a hunt on the website.
